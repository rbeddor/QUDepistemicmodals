John had a rare disease, so he went to the doctor to ask about medications.



The doctor said, ""Researchers have tested a whole bunch of different medications for this disease, but if you look at all of the published studies, you can see that every single medication they have tried hasn't worked at all."" Then the doctor started talking about a new medication called accuphine. He said, ""Accuphine might cure you. There is a new study being run right now to test it out, but they haven't released the results yet, so there is no way to know whether it works or not.""



John carefully looked at all of the publicly available research, and sure enough, judging just by the publicly available research, there was no way to know whether accuphine worked or not.



But now John wanted to know whether he should take accuphine. John happened to be friends with one of the medical researchers who was working on the study. So he decided to go talk to the medical researcher.



The medical researcher knew something that John didn't. She knew that the study had been completed and that it had been determined that accuphine didn't work at all. In fact, it had been discovered that if John took it, he would probably end up being seriously harmed.



John told the medical researcher that his doctor had said ""Accuphine might cure you."" Then John asked the medical researcher, ""Is what my doctor said true?""



The medical researcher can now answer either ""True"" or ""False."" We want to know which of these two answers you think is the correct one. So please tell us which answer is correct.","Please carefully read the following story and then answer the questions below.

In fact, it had been discovered that if John took it, he would probably end up being seriously harmed. 





But now John wanted to know whether his doctor was basically good at his job or whether he should maybe switch over to a different doctor. So he decided to go talk to the medical researcher again.
