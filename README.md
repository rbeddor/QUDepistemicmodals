# Might do Better: Flexible Relativism and the QUD


Six studies were conducted on participants recruited from Amazon Mechanical Turk.  The primary goal of the studies was to determine the effects of the question under description on judgments about the truth-values of epistemic modals (terms like 'might' and 'probably'). The raw results from the six studies are included here, with identifying information removed for participant privacy. Summary and analysis results can be found in Beddor and Egan, "Might do Better: Flexible Relativism and the QUD".
