# Might do Better: Flexible Relativism and the QUD


Six studies were conducted on participants recruited from Amazon Mechanical Turk. The primary goal of the studies was to determine the effects of the question under description on judgments about the truth-values of epistemic modals (terms like 'might' and 'probably'). The raw results from the six studies are included here, with identifying information removed for participant privacy.  The prompts and questions used in each experiment are reproduced below.  Summary and analysis of the results can be found in Beddor and Egan, "Might do Better: Flexible Relativism and the QUD".  

## Experiment 1
Participants were randomly assigned to one of two conditions: QUD-PREJACENT and QUD-COMPETENCE. All participants received a vignette that began as follows:

> John had a rare disease, so he went to the doctor to ask about medications. 
>
> The doctor said, “Researchers have tested a whole bunch of different medications for this disease, but if you look at all of the published studies, you can see that every single medication they have tried hasn't worked at all.” Then the doctor started talking about a new medication called accuphine. He said, “Accuphine might cure you. There is a new study being run right now to test it out, but they haven't released the results yet, so there is no way to know whether it works or not.”

Participants received one of two different continuations of the vignette, depending on which condition they had been assigned. Those assigned to the QUD-PREJACENT condition received the following continuation:

>John carefully looked at all of the publically available research, and sure enough, judging just by the publically available research, there was no way to know whether accuphine worked or not. But now John wanted to know whether he should take accuphine. John happened to be friends with one of the medical researchers who was working on the study. So he decided to go talk to the medical researcher. 
>
>The medical researcher knew something that John didn't. She knew that the study had been completed and that it had been determined that accuphine didn't work at all. In fact, it had been discovered that if John took it, he would probably end up being seriously harmed. 
>
>John told the medical researcher that his doctor had said “Accuphine might cure you.” Then John asked the medical researcher, “Is what my doctor said true?”

Participants assigned to the QUD-COMPETENCE condition received the following continuation instead:

>John happened to be friends with one of the medical researchers who was working on the study. She told him that the study had been completed and that it had been determined that accuphine didn't work at all. In fact, it had been discovered that if John took it, he would probably end up being seriously harmed. But now John wanted to know whether his doctor was basically good at his job or whether he should maybe switch over to a different doctor. So he decided to go talk to the medical researcher again. 
> 
>The medical researcher knew something that John didn't. She had carefully looked at all of the publically available research, and sure enough, if one judged just by the publically available research, there was no way to know whether accuphine worked or not. 
>
>John told the medical researcher that his doctor had said “Accuphine might cure you.” Then John asked the medical researcher, “Is what my doctor said true?”

In both conditions, participants were given the following question:

> The medical researcher can now answer either “True” or “False.” We want to know which of these two answers you think is the correct one. So please tell us which answer is correct. 
>
>TRUE &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; FALSE

## Experiment 2
Participants were randomly assigned to one of two conditions: QUD-PREJACENT or QUD-COMPETENCE. All participants received a vignette that began as follows:

>Fat Tony is a mobster who has faked his own death in order to evade the police.  He secretly plants highly compelling evidence of his murder at the docks.  The evidence is discovered by the authorities, and the forensic expert is summoned to the scene.  After carefully reviewing the evidence he concludes, “Fat Tony might be dead.”

Participants received one of two continuations of this vignette, depending on which condition they were assigned. Participants who were assigned to the QUD-PREJACENT condition received a continuation of the vignette containing a discussion focused on whether Fat Tony is dead:

>A week later, a detective is consulting her criminal informant about who was responsible for mob-style murder.  The informant knows that Tony is alive.
>
>Detective:  “We're trying to find the killer.  We know that the victim was an enemy of Fat Tony.  However, our forensic expert said, ‘Fat Tony might be dead.’ Is what he said true?”

Participants who were assigned to the QUD-COMPETENCE condition received a continuation of the vignette containing a discussion focused on whether the forensic expert (named “Ed” in this version of the vignette) conducted his investigation competently:
 
>A week later, another forensic expert, Ted, is given new evidence that conclusively shows that Fat Tony is still alive.  The police department is trying to determine whether the initial investigation was competent, and so sends a detective to interview Ted. 
 >
>Detective:  “We're trying to figure out whether Ed's initial investigation was competent.  On the basis of the initial evidence, Ed said, ‘Fat Tony might be dead.’ Is what he said true?’”

In both conditions participants were asked:

>Which of the following responses would be correct?
>
> (a) “No, it's not.”
>
> (b)  “Yes, it is.”

Participants in both conditions were given the same comprehension check question:

> In the scenario you were given, was Fat Tony alive?

The options were “Yes” and “No”.  

## Experiment 3
The goal of Experiment 3 was to determine whether participants were sensitive to the difference in the QUD between the two conditions.  Participants were once again divided into two conditions, QUD-PREJACENT and QUD-COMPETENCE, and received the exact same prompt as in Experiment 2.  The only difference between Experiment 2 was the question that was posed to participants.  Participants in both conditions were asked:

> In this scenario, which question is the detective most interested in finding out the answer to:

 >(a) Whether Fat Tony is alive.
 >
 >(b) Whether the initial forensic investigation at the docks was competent.

The same comprehension check question was used as in Experiment 2. 

## Experiment 4
As before, participants were assigned to one of two conditions, QUD-PREJACENT and QUD-COMPETENCE. The vignettes they received were the same as in Experiments 2 and 3, except for two differences.  First, the original forensic expert (Ed) says, “Fat Tony is probably dead”, after reviewing the evidence at the docks, rather than “Fat Tony might be dead.”  Second, the assessor (the criminal informant in the QUD-PREJACENT condition, the second forensic expert (Ted) in the QUD-COMPETENCE condition) does not know for sure that Fat Tony is alive; all they know is that it is likely that he is alive.  (The criminal informant knows this from talking to his criminal accomplices; Ted knows this on the basis of new evidence that has come to light.)  

As before, participants in both conditions were given the detective's question (“Is what he [Ed] said true?”) and asked to select which response would be correct: 

>(a) “No, it’s not.” 
>
>(b) “Yes, it is.”

## Experiment 5
As before, participants were randomly assigned to one of two conditions, QUD-PREJACENT and QUD-COMPETENCE.  All participants received a vignette that began as follows:

>John is worried he might have strep throat.  He goes to his primary care physician and she runs an initial test that indicates that there is a 75% chance that John does not have strep.  Based on the initial test results, John's doctor says:  “You probably don't have strep throat.  However, we should do a throat culture in order to be safe.  If it turns out that you have strep throat, we should put you on antibiotics.”

Participants assigned to the QUD-PREJACENT condition received the following continuation:

>John comes back two days later to find out the results of the throat culture, and sees a different doctor.  The throat culture comes up positive, which indicates there is a 90% chance that John has strep throat.  John has not yet seen the results of these tests, but his new doctor has.  John asks the new doctor: “I'm trying to figure out whether I need to take antibiotics.  My primary care physician told me, ‘You probably don't have strep.’  Is what she said true?”
> 
>Which of the following responses would be correct?
>
 >(a) “No, it's not”
 >
 >(b) “Yes, it is”

Participants assigned to the QUD-COMPETENCE condition received the following continuation instead:

>John comes back two days later to find out the results of the throat culture, and sees a different doctor.  The throat culture comes up positive, which indicates there is a 90% chance that John has strep throat. But now John wants to know whether his primary care physician made a mistake administering the initial test, so he asks:  “I'm trying to figure out whether I can rely on my primary care physician.  She told me, ‘You probably don't have strep.’  Is what she said true?”
> 
>The new doctor reviews the initial tests, and confirms that John's primary care physician had not made any mistakes interpreting the results.  Given this, which of the following responses would be correct?
> 
 >(a) “No, it's not”
 >
 >(b) “Yes, it is”

Participants in both conditions also received the following comprehension check question:

>In the scenario you just read, which of the following did John's primary care physician say?
>
 >(a) You probably have strep. 
 >
 >(b)You probably don't have strep.
 >
 >(c) You probably have pneumonia.
 >
 >(d) You probably don't have pneumonia. 

## Experiment 6
Participants were once again assigned to one two conditions, QUD-PREJACENT and QUD-COMPETENCE.  They received the same vignettes as in Experiment 5; the only difference was in their answer choices.  Rather than choosing between “No, it’s not” and “Yes, it is”, all participants were asked to choose between:

 >(a) “No, what she said isn’t true”
 >
 >(b) “Yes, what she said is true”

Participants also received the same comprehension check question as in Experiment 5.
