# Might do Better: Flexible Relativism and the QUD


Six studies were conducted on participants recruited from Amazon Mechanical Turk. The primary goal of the studies was to determine the effects of the question under description on judgments about the truth-values of epistemic modals (terms like 'might' and 'probably'). The raw results from the six studies are included here, with identifying information removed for participant privacy.  The prompts and questions used in each experiment are reproduced below.  Summary and analysis of the results can be found in Beddor and Egan, "Might do Better: Flexible Relativism and the QUD".  

## Experiment 1
Participants were assigned to one of two conditions, the QUD-PREJACENT condition and the QUD-COMPETENCE condition. All participants received a vignette that began as follows:

> John had a rare disease, so he went to the doctor to ask about medications. 
>
> The doctor said, “Researchers have tested a whole bunch of different medications for this disease, but if you look at all of the published studies, you can see that every single medication they have tried hasn't worked at all.” Then the doctor started talking about a new medication called accuphine. He said, “Accuphine might cure you. There is a new study being run right now to test it out, but they haven't released the results yet, so there is no way to know whether it works or not.”

Participants received one of two different continuations of the vignette, depending on which condition they had been assigned. Those assigned to the QUD-PREJACENT condition received the following continuation:

>John carefully looked at all of the publically available research, and sure enough, judging just by the publically available research, there was no way to know whether accuphine worked or not. But now John wanted to know whether he should take accuphine. John happened to be friends with one of the medical researchers who was working on the study. So he decided to go talk to the medical researcher. 
>
>The medical researcher knew something that John didn't. She knew that the study had been completed and that it had been determined that accuphine didn't work at all. In fact, it had been discovered that if John took it, he would probably end up being seriously harmed. 
>
>John told the medical researcher that his doctor had said “Accuphine might cure you.” Then John asked the medical researcher, “Is what my doctor said true?”

Participants assigned to the QUD-COMPETENCE condition received the following continuation instead:

>John happened to be friends with one of the medical researchers who was working on the study. She told him that the study had been completed and that it had been determined that accuphine didn't work at all. In fact, it had been discovered that if John took it, he would probably end up being seriously harmed. But now John wanted to know whether his doctor was basically good at his job or whether he should maybe switch over to a different doctor. So he decided to go talk to the medical researcher again. 
> 
>The medical researcher knew something that John didn't. She had carefully looked at all of the publically available research, and sure enough, if one judged just by the publically available research, there was no way to know whether accuphine worked or not. 
>
>John told the medical researcher that his doctor had said “Accuphine might cure you.” Then John asked the medical researcher, “Is what my doctor said true?”

In both conditions, participants were given the following question:

> The medical researcher can now answer either “True” or “False.” We want to know which of these two answers you think is the correct one. So please tell us which answer is correct. 
>
>TRUE &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; FALSE
