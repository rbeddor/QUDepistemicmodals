He goes to hisprimary care physician and she runs an initial test that indicates that thereis a 75% chance that John does not have strep.  Based on the initial testresults, John’s doctor says:  “You probably don’t have strep throat.  However, we should do a throat culturein order to be safe.  If it turnsout that you have strep throat, we should put you on antibiotics.” John comes back two days later to find out the results of thethroat culture, and talks to a different doctor.  The throat culture comes up positive,which indicates there is a 90% chance that John has strep throat.  Johnhas not yet seen the results of these tests, but his new doctor has.  Johnasks the new doctor:  “I’m trying to figure out whether I need to takeantibiotics.  My primary carephysician told me, ‘You probably don’t have strep.’  Is what she saidtrue?"" Which of the following responses would be correct?","John is worried he might have strep throat.
